# Hospital-Readmission-Project
### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A hospital readmission is an episode when a patient who had been discharged from a hospital is admitted again within a specified time interval. Readmission rates have increasingly been used as an outcome measure in health services research and as a quality benchmark for health systems. Hospital readmission rates were formally included in reimbursement decisions for the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, which penalizes health systems with higher-than-expected readmission rates through the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program. The real-world clinical care data provided in this competition comes from multiple hospitals across the United States for several years.


***The challenge:***

In this machine learning problem, an attempt was made to predict whether or not a patient will be readmitted to the hospital. The target takes on binary values where 0 implies that the patient was not readmitted, and 1 implies that the patient was readmitted. The latter is predicted.
Classification is evaluated using log loss. The predictions therefore are probabilities of readmission. Evaluation will be based on how well model can predict if the hospital readmits on a test data set available on the Kaggle.com competition page.
